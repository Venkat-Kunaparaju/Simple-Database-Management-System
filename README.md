# Simple Database Management System

## Overview
This is a simple DBMS where the program controls the management and allocation of the heap memory with no explicit call to malloc(). All the databases, tables, row entries, etc. are dynamically allocated and are mapped onto the heap based on the program's custom mapper. This allows for the searching and management of different tables to be more optimized and less memory intensive. To interact with the DBMS, SQL syntax and commands are used.
